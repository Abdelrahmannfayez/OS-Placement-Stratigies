# Memory Allocation Algorithms: Best-Fit and First-Fit
### Welcome to the Memory Allocation Algorithms repository! ðŸ§ ðŸ’»

In this repository, we explore two powerful memory allocation algorithms: Best-Fit and First-Fit. These algorithms play a crucial role in optimizing memory utilization by efficiently placing processes in memory, reducing fragmentation, and maximizing available memory for improved system performance.

## Introduction
Memory fragmentation can hinder system performance by wasting memory space and causing inefficient memory allocation. The aim of this repository is to provide an in-depth exploration of the Best-Fit and First-Fit memory allocation algorithms. By understanding their implementation and characteristics, developers can make informed decisions about which algorithm to use in different scenarios.

## Algorithms
#### Best-Fit Algorithm
The Best-Fit algorithm focuses on placing a process in the memory block that best fits its size. It iterates through available memory blocks and selects the one with the smallest size that can accommodate the process. This approach helps to minimize fragmentation over time and leads to efficient memory utilization.



#### First-Fit Algorithm
The First-Fit algorithm is a simple yet effective approach to memory allocation. It places processes in the first available memory block that is large enough to accommodate them. While this algorithm might lead to more fragmentation compared to Best-Fit, it's relatively easy to implement and can perform well in certain scenarios.
